## Disclaimer
This repo contains source code to a powerful malware.
The test release versions might not always contain warnings that it is a malware, so be careful handling this malware.
The "is it truly that powerful?" question you can answer for yourselves after testing in a virtual machine.
Currently, there will not be any releases as it is still being tested. That doesn't mean there will be no release.

## What Is Saturn?
Saturn is a malware that recreates some NoEscape payloads (except January 14th One, I Don't Know How You Pulled It Of [Enderman](https://youtube.com/c/Endermanch)).
It has some other payloads and overall just mentioning all the things will not be of any use, so once the exe is out, you can all test it in a virtual machine.
