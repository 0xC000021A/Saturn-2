# Saturn (Project Soni)
## Disclaimer
This repo contains source code to a powerful malware.
The test release versions might not always contain warnings that it is a malware, so be careful handling this malware.
The "is it truly that powerful?" question you can answer for yourselves after testing in a virtual machine.
Currently, there will not be any releases as it is still being tested. That doesn't mean there will be no release.

## What Is Saturn?
Saturn is a malware that recreates some NoEscape payloads (except January 14th One, I Don't Know How You Pulled It Off [Enderman](https://youtube.com/c/Endermanch)).
It has some other payloads and overall just mentioning all the things will not be of any use, so once the exe is out, you can all test it in a virtual machine.

### Additional Info
+ ***Saturn.exe Full Stable Build Progress: 50%***
+ ***Saturn.exe Deadline Date: 18/9/2022. (45 Days Remaining)***
+ ***Current Developmental Phase: Pre-Test***
+ ***Next Developmental Phase: Alpha Test***
+ ***Current Predicted Stability Phase:***

The Deadline Is There Just For Fun. The Deadline Date Is My Cat's Birthday.
There Are Many Developmental Phases: Pre-Test (Pre-Code Verification), Alpha Test, Beta Test, Gamma Test, Delta Test, Lambda Test, General Stabilization (Code Cleanup, Set-Wise Debugging), Release Candidates 1-6, Release Stabilization And Post-Release Fixes.
Phases After General Stabilization Will Have A Release Of The Malware For Review Purposes. ***THESE MIGHT NOT ALWAYS CONTAIN A WARNING IN CASE OF ACCIDENTAL EXECUTION ON AN ELEVATED USER ACCOUNT.*** Have UAC On At Times When You Are Copying The Malware To Virtual Machine For Testing Or Run On An Unelevated User Account.
