## What Is Saturn?
Saturn is a malware that recreates some NoEscape payloads (except January 14th One, I Don't Know How You Pulled It Of [Enderman](https://youtube.com/c/Endermanch)).
It has some other payloads and overall just mentioning all the things will not be of any use, so once the exe is out, you can all test it in a virtual machine.
